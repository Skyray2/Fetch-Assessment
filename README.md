# Fetch-Assessment
This repository contains all the files that were required for the completion of the Fetch Assessment. 

Initially, this task was tried using various ML models to check how the result would appear. Out of the traditional ML models, Random Forest Regressor was the best-performing model and gave decent enough results. So, it was decided that this was the model that should be chosen and it was written from scratch as it can be found in the RandomForestReg.ipynb file. 
In this code, random forest regression was implemented from scratch with the use of decision tree as its base and further GARCH was used to smoothen the and get a more accurate result. But, this was not providing satisfying results and hence, I decided that I should try some other methods.
